# Book: The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand To Tetris)

Repository created during my readings of: "The Elements of Computing Systems"

<br>The folders in this repository follows the same organization of the book (first 5 chapters focused in hardware and remaining of the book in software).
<br>Part 1: Simple logic gates (File .sim1 was created in software SimulIDE and some circuits contains its schematic created in Nand).
<br>Part 2: Composite logic gates + ALU.
<br>Project files also available at: [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ITEek4Hh/nand2tetris-hardware)
